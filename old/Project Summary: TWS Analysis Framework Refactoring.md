# Project Summary: TWS Analysis Framework Refactoring

## Refactoring Overview

This project involved a comprehensive refactoring of R code used for analyzing Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data from GRACE satellites compared with climate model ensembles (CESM2 and IPSL).

## What Was Done

### 1. Code Organization
- **Original:** 4 large monolithic R script files with mixed functions
- **Refactored:** 48 individual function files organized into 10 logical categories
- **Result:** Improved modularity, maintainability, and reusability

### 2. Function Naming
All functions were renamed following consistent conventions:
- Descriptive verbs indicating action (e.g., `analyze_`, `calculate_`, `create_`)
- Clear nouns indicating subject matter (e.g., `_basin_tws`, `_ensemble_spread_metrics`)
- Removed ambiguous names like `analyze_one` â†’ `analyze_basin_tws`

### 3. Documentation Enhancement
Each function file now includes:
- Comprehensive header with function purpose
- Original function name for reference
- Source file information
- Detailed description of the analysis being performed
- Clear indication of its role in the overall framework

### 4. Category Structure

**Core Analysis** (3 functions)
- Main entry points for running TWS analyses
- Basin-level and multi-basin analysis functions

**Data Processing** (4 functions)
- Data extraction, merging, and formatting
- Spatial data integration

**Ensemble Metrics** (3 functions)
- Statistical calculations for ensemble spread
- Variance and amplitude metrics

**Extreme Analysis** (3 functions)
- Drought and pluvial event analysis
- Extreme coverage assessment

**Figures** (10 functions)
- Publication-quality figure generation
- Manuscript-specific visualizations

**Interpretation** (1 function)
- Qualitative interpretation of quantitative results

**Mapping** (6 functions)
- Geographic visualization
- Robinson projection handling
- Spatial data plotting

**Utilities** (3 functions)
- Helper functions
- Data classification and binning

**Visualization** (7 functions)
- Nature journal style themes
- Color scales and formatting
- Figure saving utilities

**Wavelet Analysis** (8 functions)
- Spectral analysis pipeline
- Dominant mode identification
- Timescale evaluation

## Key Improvements

1. **Modularity:** Functions can now be sourced and used independently
2. **Clarity:** Improved naming makes code self-documenting
3. **Maintainability:** Easier to locate, update, and debug specific functions
4. **Collaboration:** Better structure for team-based development
5. **Publication-Ready:** Organized for GitHub release alongside research paper

## Files Included

- **README.md:** Main repository documentation
- **GETTING_STARTED.md:** Quick start guide and usage examples
- **FUNCTION_CATALOG.md:** Complete function reference
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md:** This file
- **LICENSE:** MIT License for open-source distribution
- **48 R function files** organized in 10 category directories

## Original Source Files

The refactored code originated from:
1. `F01_Functions_MMLEs_vs_GGFO_Jun2025.R` (23 functions)
2. `core_tws_functions.R` (15 functions)
3. `SourceNaturePlots.R` (13 functions)
4. `Claude_18_Qs_results_amplitude_Extremes.R` (15 functions)

Note: Some functions appeared in multiple source files; duplicates were removed during refactoring.

## Usage

See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Add unit tests for each function
2. Create example datasets for demonstration
3. Develop vignettes for common workflows
4. Add continuous integration for automated testing
5. Create an R package structure for easier installation
